TOP HTML Recipes Project
This the end project of the HTML Foundations course. After its completion,
I want to have demonstrated that I have a firm understanding of the undertaken
html foundations course by building a recipes website by using the correct and appropriate 
code to fulfil the desired purpose and outcome.
I also want to show that I have understood the basics of git, how it works
and how to properly utilize git using the git commands.
