TOP HTML Foundations Recipes Project.

After its completion, I want to have demonstrated that I have a firm understanding of the 
HTML Foundations course by building an excellent recipes website.
I also want to show that I have understood the basics of git, how it works
and how to properly utilize git using the git commands.
